4.Question 4
What type of hashing algorithm does Bitcoin blockchain use to determine the hash of a block?

SHA-1


MD5

 
SHA-256            ✔


SHA-512

5.Question 5
In Ethereum, which algorithm is applied to the private key in order to get a unique public key.


SHA 256


ECC       ✔


Keccak


RSA

Correct
That’s correct. Addresses of account are generated using the public key-private key pair. First, a 256-bit random number is generated and designated as a private key, kept secure and locked using a passphrase. Then an ECC algorithm is applied to the private key to get a unique public key.

6.Question 6
Which of the following methods can be used to obtain the original message from its generated hash message using SHA-256?


Hashing the generated hash again, twice


Hashing the generated hash again       ✔


Original message cannot be retrieved


Hashing the reverse of generated hash

Incorrect
That’s incorrect. Please review the lesson on “Hashing”

7.Question 7
In Ethereum, hashing functions are used for which of the following?

1. Generating state hash.

2. Generating account addresses.

3. Decrypting senders message.

4. Generating block header hash.


1,2,3


2,3,4


1,3,4


1,2,4         ✔

Correct
That’s correct. In Ethereum, hashing functions are used for generating account addresses, digital signatures, transaction hash, state hash, receipt hash, and block header hash.

8.Question 8
What is the purpose of using a digital signature?


None of the above.


It supports user authentication


It supports both user authentication and integrity of messages          ✔


It supports the integrity of messages

Correct
That’s correct. A valid digital signature gives a recipient reason to believe that the message was created by a known sender (authentication), that the sender cannot deny having sent the message, and that the message was not altered in transit (integrity).
